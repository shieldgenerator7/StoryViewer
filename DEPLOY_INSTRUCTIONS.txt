go to console:
npm run predeploy

when thats done, find /dist/index.html, and on lines 9 and 10, add a period "." to the beginning of the file path
"./assets/"

go to console
npm run deployonly



you should be good to go!


=======
p.s. package.json has the version number that you should update if you want to update it
